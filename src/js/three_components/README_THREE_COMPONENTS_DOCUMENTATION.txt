REVIEW:
-------
The three_components/ directory showcases sophisticated 3D graphics programming
that effectively combines computer vision with advanced rendering techniques. The
code demonstrates deep understanding of 3D mathematics, coordinate transformations,
and real-time rendering optimization.

The glasses positioning algorithm is particularly impressive, using multiple
facial landmarks to calculate accurate 3D placement and rotation. The dual camera
system shows thoughtful consideration of the trade-offs between accuracy and
visual appeal. The video background system efficiently handles the challenging
task of real-time texture updates.

The architecture is well-designed with clear separation of concerns, making it
easy to maintain and extend. The performance optimizations show professional-level
understanding of real-time graphics programming. This is high-quality 3D graphics
code that successfully bridges the gap between computer vision and rendering.
