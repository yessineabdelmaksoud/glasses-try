3D MODELS FOLDER DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

FOLDER PURPOSE:
This folder contains all 3D assets for the virtual glasses try-on application,
including GLTF model files, textures, and binary data. These models are loaded
dynamically by the Three.js rendering engine and positioned on users' faces
using MediaPipe facial landmarks.

GLTF TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION:
================================================================================

**File Format Standards:**
- GLTF 2.0: JSON-based 3D scene format
- Binary Buffers: Efficient geometry storage (.bin files)
- PBR Materials: Physically Based Rendering support
- Texture Mapping: UV coordinate systems for material application

**Rendering Pipeline Integration:**
- Three.js GLTFLoader: Automatic parsing and scene integration
- Material System: PBR shader support with metallic-roughness workflow
- Animation Support: Node transformation capabilities (unused currently)
- LOD Potential: Multiple detail levels could be implemented

**Performance Considerations:**
- Vertex Count Impact: Higher vertex models require more GPU memory
- Texture Resolution: Affects both quality and loading time
- Binary vs Embedded: External .bin files enable better caching
- Compression: DRACO compression could reduce file sizes significantly

================================================================================
MATERIAL SYSTEM ANALYSIS:
================================================================================

**PBR Material Properties:**
- Base Color: RGB values for surface appearance
- Metallic Factor: 0.0 = dielectric, 1.0 = metallic
- Roughness Factor: 0.0 = mirror-like, 1.0 = completely rough
- Alpha Mode: OPAQUE, MASK, or BLEND for transparency

**Texture Channel Usage:**
- Base Color Texture: Diffuse color information (RGB)
- Metallic-Roughness Texture: 
  - B channel: Metallic values
  - G channel: Roughness values
  - R channel: Unused (ambient occlusion potential)

**Material Quality Levels:**
1. Black Model: High-quality with dedicated texture maps
2. Grey Model: Medium quality with image-based textures
3. Brown Model: Basic quality with embedded materials

================================================================================
INTEGRATION WITH APPLICATION:
================================================================================

**Loading Workflow:**
1. User selects glasses style from UI buttons
2. Application retrieves model path from configuration
3. Three.js GLTFLoader fetches GLTF file asynchronously
4. Binary buffers and textures loaded in parallel
5. Model parsed and added to scene hierarchy
6. Materials compiled for GPU rendering

**Positioning System:**
- MediaPipe provides 468 facial landmark points
- Specific landmarks identify nose bridge position
- 3D transformation matrix calculated for glasses placement
- Real-time updates maintain alignment during head movement

**Rendering Optimization:**
- Frustum culling when glasses not visible
- Level-of-detail switching based on distance
- Material batching for multiple glasses instances
- Texture atlas potential for reduced draw calls

================================================================================
ASSET MANAGEMENT:
================================================================================

**File Organization Strategy:**
- Color-based folder naming (black, brown, grey)
- Consistent GLTF naming convention within folders
- Separate texture directories for complex models
- Binary data isolation for optimal caching

**Loading Performance:**
- Progressive loading: GLTF first, then textures and binaries
- Parallel asset downloading for faster initialization
- Browser caching for repeated sessions
- Preloading optimization for anticipated selections

**Memory Management:**
- Model pooling for efficient GPU memory usage
- Texture sharing between similar materials
- Garbage collection awareness for scene disposal
- LOD system potential for distance-based optimization
